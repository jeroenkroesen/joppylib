# JopPyLib
Python abstraction over the Joplin data api  
  
==WARNING==
JopPyLib is under heavy development. I've only just started. I will update this readme when a first usable version is released.

JopPyLib is part of the [Artumis project](https://jeroenkroesen.github.io/artumis_site/). It is meant to be a thin layer to enable programmatic manipulation of Joplin notes via a higher level interface than the data API.  
  
JopPyLib is highly opinionated because it is designed to enable a higher level library call [JopBrainLib](https://github.com/jeroenkroesen/jopbrainlib) that enables second brain functionality in Joplin.  
  
An [example Jupyter notebook interface](https://github.com/jeroenkroesen/joppylib-notebook) is available for interacting with JopPyLib.
